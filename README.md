Frogger_in_Assembly
===================

Course Programming Project:  Frogger game in assembly and c.

A simple recreation of the classic game Frogger.

libc.asm and lc4libc.h were given to me for the assignment.

The game itself runs in assembly, but the game logic is written in c and displayed using assembly.  os.asm was mostly prewritten for me except for Traps that involved drawing pixels onto the display.

Basic skeleton of the game was given to me for the assignment, however game mechanics and logic written by myself as well.
