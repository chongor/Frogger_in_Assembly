Frogger_in_Assembly
===================

Course Programming Project:  Frogger game in assembly and c.

A simple recreation of the classic game Frogger.

The game code is written in c however the game runs in assembly on a virtual machine simulator.

lc4lib.h and libc.asm given for this assignment.
frogger_script is used for assembling the game and loading all the game object code.

Most of the game code in frogger.c was written by myself, with some initial framework files given for the assignment.  Most of os.asm was given for the assignment and TRAPS involving drawing pixels onto the display was developed by myself.
